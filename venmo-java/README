1. How to make/run this program
	a. run Makefile (ex. make)
	b. execute the output (ex. java miniVenmo)
	c. clean beforehand if needed (ex. make clean)
	d. the program expects either zero or one arguments
	    1. no argument will execute the program as interactive mode
	    2. one argument will execute the program as batch mode, which will read that argument as a file name to read
    e. 'java miniVenmo test' will read test cases and execute

2. Design decisions
	Used HashMap for Users and Cards info to keep track of them and their unique existence
	Used Factory Pattern to extend card issue process for other types of cards
	Used BigDecimal type for balance to avoid overflow

3. The language I chose and why I chose it
	a. Java provides useful Data Structure classes
	b. Java has handy String / Array related methods
